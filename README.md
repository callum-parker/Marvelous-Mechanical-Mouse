# Marvelous-Mechanical-Mouse
Marvelous Mechanical Mouse, a tool for recording a series of keyboard and mouse actions and replaying them. Includes settings for speed of mouse motion and click action, a setting for variance for each of those, and a timer mode.

Planned future features include a means of saving and loading the macros along with associated keybindings, and a revamped GUI.
