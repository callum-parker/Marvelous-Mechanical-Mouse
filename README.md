# Marvelous-Mechanical-Mouse
Marvelous Mechanical Mouse, a tool for recording a series of keyboard and mouse actions and replaying them.

The latest update includes a revamped UI using Qt5, and the addition of keybindings provided by my keybind_detector package (currently only available via github).

Planned future additions include the ability to tie macro calls to specific keybindings, actual documentation, a useful status bar, and unit tests.

working builds available in the dist folder.
